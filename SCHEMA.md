# SCHEMA — chain data layer

Canonical reference for the on-chain data layer used by VerusLending and
related contract primitives. This is the *interop contract*: any wallet,
indexer, or library that follows this spec can read/write the same
entries as the reference implementation.

The chain is the source of truth. Indexers (`.85`, others) cache and
expose this data, but never amend or override what's on chain.

---

## 1. VDXF key namespace

All keys live under the VRSC system namespace (`vrsc::`) under the
top-level category `contract`. This sits at the same level as Verus's
existing `system`, `profile`, and `contentmultimap` categories.

```
vrsc::contract.<usecase>.<entity>
```

Singular `contract` matches Verus's own convention (`system`, `profile`,
`contentmultimap` are all singular).

### Locked VDXF keys

| Key | VDXF id | Purpose | Visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vrsc::contract.loan.offer`     | `iA1vgVBV5B29h5pxQ67gxqCoEaLDZ8WbmY` | lender's rate sheet | public |

| `vrsc::contract.swap.offer`     | `iMJXdbEqZ1wS4SGKSJGFp4vzcDUhhciZGV` | atomic swap offer | public |

VDXF ids are deterministic from the key string. Re-derive via
`verus getvdxfid "vrsc::contract.loan.offer"`.

### Versioning

Versioning happens **inside the JSON payload**, not in the key name.
Verus keys never use `.vN` suffixes — the key id is stable, payloads
embed `version: <int>`. Schema upgrades bump the internal version;
readers handle multiple versions gracefully.

```json
{ "version": 1, "type": "lend", … }
```

---

## 2. Storage format

Each multimap entry is a **hex-encoded UTF-8 JSON string** stored in the
identity's `contentmultimap` array under the appropriate VDXF id.

```
contentmultimap:
  iA1vgVBV5B29h5pxQ67gxqCoEaLDZ8WbmY:
    - "7b2276657273696f6e223a312c..."   # hex(JSON.stringify(payload))
    - "7b2276657273696f6e223a322c..."   # additional offer (multimap = array)
```

### Encoding rules

- Compact JSON (no whitespace, sorted keys preferred but not required)
- UTF-8
- Hex (lowercase)
- One entry per offer/state. Multiple offers per ID = multiple array elements.

### Encrypted entries

For `*.accept` and `*.template` keys:

1. Build payload JSON
2. Encrypt to recipient's identity z-key (or self for templates)
3. Hex-encode the ciphertext
4. Store same as public entries

Encryption uses Verus's identity z-encryption primitives. Recipients
decrypt with their seed-derived z-key.

### Updates and deletes

- **Update**: write the entire array back with the modified entry
- **Delete**: write the array without the entry, OR set `active: false`
  in the payload to soft-delete (preserves history while signaling stale)
- **Replace**: same as update — chain only sees the latest array

---

## 3. Payload schemas

### `contract.loan.offer` — lender posts a rate sheet

A lender's *advertising material*: "I'll lend up to X, accepting these
collateral currencies, requiring this collateralization, at this rate."
Borrowers post `loan.request` against this; lenders pre-sign `loan.match`
against specific requests they want to fund.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "max_principal":        { "currency": "DAI", "amount": 100 },
  "accepted_collateral":  ["VRSC", "DAI", "BTC"],
  "min_collateral_ratio": 2.0,
  "rate":                 0.01,
  "term_days":            30,
  "active":               true,
  "memo":                 "optional human note"
}
```

### `contract.loan.request` — borrower posts a specific request

A borrower's exact terms: "I want to borrow X, willing to put up Y, will
repay Z by maturity." No `max_rate` — the borrower pre-states the
repayment they're willing to honor; the implied rate is `(repay/principal − 1)`.

**v2 (current)** — adds the borrower's pre-signed Tx-A input plus the
target lender. The borrower constructs the full Tx-A skeleton (their input,
their change output, the principal output going to themselves, and the
collateral output going to the 2-of-2 vault P2SH derived from both pubkeys)
and signs their own input with `SIGHASH_ALL|ANYONECANPAY`. The lender can
then add their own input and pre-sign all three settlement templates (Tx-A,
Tx-Repay, Tx-B) in one shot at match-post time, then go offline forever.

Required fields:
- `target_lender_iaddr` — the borrower picked a specific lender to direct
  this request at; the lender's pubkey is resolved from this iaddr's
  primary R-address.
- `borrower_input_signed_hex` — Tx-A skeleton hex with the borrower's
  input signed `SIGHASH_ALL|ANYONECANPAY`. The hex contains:
    - 1 input: borrower's collateral UTXO (signed)
    - 3 outputs: principal → borrower's R, collateral → vault P2SH, change
  The lender extends by adding input 0 (their principal UTXO) before
  signing their own portion.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "principal":  { "currency": "DAI",  "amount": 5 },
  "collateral": { "currency": "VRSC", "amount": 10 },
  "repay":      { "currency": "DAI",  "amount": 5.05 },
  "term_days":  30,
  "target_lender_iaddr":      "i7A9fa…",
  "borrower_input_signed_hex": "0400008085202f8901…",
  "active":     true
}
```

**v1 (legacy)** — terms only, no UTXO commitment, no signed input. Indexers
and GUIs should still read v1 entries (older requests on chain remain valid),
but matches against v1 requests can't be fully pre-signed — they need a
cooperative cosigning handshake at accept time, which is an older flow not
maintained here.

### `contract.loan.match` — lender pre-signs a funding offer

Posted on the lender's identity, points at a specific borrower's request,
and contains all three pre-signed partial transactions needed for the
borrower to atomically originate the loan with one click.

The lender's principal UTXO is committed via `SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY`
on `tx_a_partial`. The lender's vault-half signatures on Tx-Repay and Tx-B
templates ensure the loan can be settled cooperatively or defaulted on at
maturity, even if the lender never comes online again.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "request": {
    "iaddr": "iFmi…goy",
    "txid":  "5ea5ad…",
    "block": 4051726
  },
  "lender_address":      "R...",
  "vault_address":       "b...",
  "vault_redeem_script": "<hex of OP_2 <lender_pubkey> <borrower_pubkey> OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG>",
  "tx_a_partial":        "<hex, lender input signed SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY>",
  "tx_repay_partial":    "<hex, lender vault-half signed SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY>",
  "tx_b_partial":        "<hex, lender vault-half signed SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY, locktime=maturity>",
  "expires_block":       4060000,
  "active":              true
}
```

The lender's bound UTXO can be verified as still-unspent by checking
on chain — explorer endpoints (`/api/contracts/loans/matches`) include
this verification in their response so the borrower's wallet can flag
stale matches.

### `contract.loan.status` — active loan (one entry per role)

Posted by both parties to their own identities after Tx-A confirms.
The pair of entries (one per role) makes the loan publicly visible
and correlatable. `loan_id` is the Tx-A txid (shared identifier).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "loan_id":          "5e386061…cda4bd",
  "role":             "lender" | "borrower",
  "counterparty":     "i7A9…wg" | "iFmi…goy",
  "vault_address":    "b...",
  "principal":        { "currency": "VRSC", "amount": 5 },
  "collateral":       { "currency": "VRSC", "amount": 10 },
  "repay":            { "currency": "VRSC", "amount": 5.05 },
  "term_days":        30,
  "originated_block": 4051862,
  "maturity_block":   4095062,
  "settled":          false,
  "settled_tx":       null
}
```

When the loan settles (Tx-Repay broadcast, Tx-B broadcast, or rescue),
each party flips `settled: true` and writes `settled_tx: <txid>` so
indexers can derive outcome.

### `contract.loan.history` — outcome attestation

Both parties write at settlement. Truth is the on-chain settlement tx;
this is just an indexable summary for reputation.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "vault_address": "b...",
  "role": "lender" | "borrower",
  "counterparty_id": "alice.foo@",
  "counterparty_address": "R...",
  "principal":  { "currency": "VRSC", "amount": 5 },
  "collateral": { "currency": "VRSC", "amount": 10 },
  "rate": 0.10,
  "term_days": 30,
  "originated_tx": "...",
  "originated_block": ...,
  "outcome": "settled" | "defaulted" | "rescued",
  "outcome_tx": "...",
  "outcome_block": ...
}
```

### `contract.loan.accept` — encrypted

Borrower → lender after deciding to take an offer. Contains borrower's
pubkey + R-addr so lender can derive the vault and proceed.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "target_offer_txid": "...",
  "target_offer_index": 0,
  "borrower_pubkey": "03...",
  "borrower_address": "R...",
  "proposed_block": 4050600
}
```

Encrypted to lender's identity z-key, hex-encoded ciphertext.

### `contract.loan.template` — encrypted (self)

Backup of pre-signed Tx-Repay / Tx-B / Tx-C templates so they survive a
wiped browser. Encrypted to self.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "vault_address": "b...",
  "tx_repay_hex": "...",
  "tx_b_hex": "...",
  "tx_c_hex": "..."
}
```

### Options / Escrow / Swap

Same shape, different fields. Schemas TBD as those flows mature. Key
ids are pre-allocated above to avoid future churn.

---

## 4. Indexer requirements (e.g., `.85` and any alternative)

An indexer SHOULD:

- Track new blocks; for each, scan `updateidentity` txs
- Extract `contentmultimap` entries against the locked VDXF ids
- Decode hex → UTF-8 → JSON; validate against the published schema
- Store with metadata: source iaddress + friendly, vdxf_key, entry_index,
  block height/timestamp, txid
- Mark previous entries with same `(source, vdxf_key, entry_index)` as
  `replaced` when superseded
- Auto-mark `expired` when `valid_until_block` (or equivalent) passes
- Expose query API (see API spec below)

An indexer MUST NOT:

- Hold funds or facilitate transactions
- Match counterparties on its server
- Charge fees per offer / take / settlement
- Rewrite or curate chain content (filtering for display is fine; the
  underlying data must remain queryable)

The indexer is a **passive directory**. Same legal profile as a block
explorer.

---

## 5. API spec (any compliant indexer)

```
GET  /api/contract.loan.offer
       ?currency=VRSC&min_principal=1&max_term=90&active=true&limit=50&offset=0
GET  /api/contract.loan.offer/{id_or_iaddress}
GET  /api/contract.loan.history/{id_or_iaddress}
GET  /api/contract.loan.status/{vault_address_or_id}
GET  /api/contract.option.offer
GET  /api/contract.escrow.offer
GET  /api/contract.swap.offer
GET  /api/vdxf/{vdxf_key_or_id}            # generic — any tracked key
```

### Response shape (uniform)

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "source": {
        "id": "108of200.vlotto@",
        "iaddress": "i44CxABWkVnUhoPMjuM2ViJDDu2icd7jg7",
        "friendly": "3965555_108of200.vlotto@"
      },
      "vdxf_key": "vrsc::contract.loan.offer",
      "vdxf_id": "iA1vgVBV5B29h5pxQ67gxqCoEaLDZ8WbmY",
      "entry_index": 0,
      "payload": { "...decoded JSON..." },
      "raw_hex": "7b22...",
      "chain": {
        "txid": "...",
        "block": 4050546,
        "timestamp": 1746245678
      },
      "status": "active" | "replaced" | "expired"
    }
  ],
  "next_offset": 50,
  "indexed_through_block": 4050591
}
```

### Conventions

- No POST endpoints — read-only
- No auth
- CORS-enabled
- 200 OK with empty `results: []` when nothing matches
- 4xx for malformed queries; 5xx for indexer errors

## 6. Reference schema for postgres (suggested)

```sql
CREATE TABLE chain_entries (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  vdxf_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  vdxf_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_iaddress TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_friendly TEXT,
  entry_index INT NOT NULL,
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  raw_hex TEXT NOT NULL,
  block_height INT NOT NULL,
  block_timestamp BIGINT,
  txid TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  observed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX ON chain_entries (vdxf_key, status, block_height DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON chain_entries (source_iaddress);
CREATE INDEX ON chain_entries (txid);
```

---

## 7. Open questions / future

- **Project namespace**: should `contract.*` move under a registered
  `contracts@` or `verus-contracts@` parent ID for stronger isolation?
  Costs ~100 VRSC for the top-level. Defer until something forces it.
- **Encrypted entry indexing**: should the API expose encrypted entries
  in raw form, or omit them? Currently SHOULD include — readability
  by recipient is up to them.
- **Schema validation**: should indexers reject entries failing schema?
  Currently SHOULD store-and-mark-malformed, not drop, so authors can
  see their bad data in the API.
